# vhilla-timer
This timer app is used to determine approximately when the Verus Hilla Reap Mechanic occurs.
Use the time given as a guide as Verus Hilla's reap mechanic may be off by a few seconds

#How to use
Ideally, you want the timer at the top to match the timer of your run.
VHilla generally has 3 phases for the time it takes the reap mechanic to occur.
These phases can be approximated based on the amount of health she has.
The first phase starts from full health to approximately 30% of the second (pink) health bar.
The second phase goes from 30% of second (pink) health bar to approximately 20% third (yellow/green) health bar.
The last phase goes from 20% third (yellow/green) health bar onward. 
Try to match the phase as best as you can.
When reap occurs, press the 'FMA' button. This will calculate the time that the next Reap will occur.
